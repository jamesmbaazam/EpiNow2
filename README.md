*This package is under development with breaking changes likely.*

This package estimates the time-varying reproduction number, rate of
spread, and doubling time using a range of open-source tools and current
best practices. It aims to help users avoid some of the limitations of
naive implementations in a framework that is informed by community
feedback and is under active development. It assumes that only limited
data is available on cases by date of onset and instead uses cases by
date of report. These are then imputed to case counts by date of
infection using an uncertain reporting delay and incubation period via a
Gaussian process based method. Right truncation of cases is dealt with
internally by `{EpiNow2}`, as is propogating uncertainty from all inputs
into the final parameter estimates (helping to mitigate spurious
findings). Time-varying estimates of the reproduction number are
estimated using a similar approach to that implemented in the
[`{EpiEstim}`](https://github.com/annecori/EpiEstim) package by date of
infection with a generation time estimate that includes uncertainty and
variation over time controlled using a Gaussian process. Time-varying
estimates of the rate of growth are derived from the time-varying
reproduction estimates and the uncertain generation time. Optionally,
the time-varying reproduction number can be forecast forwards in time
using an integration with the
[`{EpiSoon}`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiSoon) package and converted to
a case forecast using the renewal equation. Alternatively, the
time-varying reproduction number and cases can be forecast using a
Gaussian process. See the
[methods](https://epiforecasts.io/covid/methods.html) section of our
Covid-19 site for a detailed discussion of the approach.

## Installation

Install the stable version of the package using
[`{drat}`](https://epiforecasts.io/drat/):

``` r
install.packages("drat")
drat:::add("epiforecasts")
install.packages("EpiNow2")
```

Install the development version of the package with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("epiforecasts/EpiNow2")
```

For simple deployment/development a prebuilt docker image is also
available (see documentation
[here](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2/wiki/Docker)).

## Quick start

*Under development*

See the documentation for
[`epinow`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/epinow.html),
[`estimate_infections`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/estimate_infections.html),
and
[`forecast_infections`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/forecast_infections.html).
For more on using each function see the [function
documentation](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/index.html). A
working implementation for COVID-19 can be found
[here](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid-global/blob/master/update_nowcasts.R).

### Reporting templates

Rmarkdown templates are provided in the package (`templates`) for
semi-automated reporting of the estimates. These are currently
undocumented but an example integration can be seen
[here](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid/blob/master/_posts/national/united-kingdom/united-kingdom.Rmd).
If using these templates to report your results please highlight our
[limitations](https://epiforecasts.io/covid/) as these are key to
understanding our results.

## Contributing

File an issue [here](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2/issues) if
you have identified an issue with the package. Please note that due to
operational constraints priority will be given to users informing
government policy or offering methodological insights. We welcome all
contributions, in particular those that improve the approach or the
robustness of the code base.
